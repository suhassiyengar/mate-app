## About
In a world where healthcare costs can be a significant burden, we believe finding affordable medicine shouldn't be a luxury. Access to transparent pricing and clear options is a right, not a privilege. This belief is the foundation of mate, a platform born from a desire to empower consumers and bring clarity to the often-confusing pharmaceutical market. We saw a simple problem—high medicine prices and a lack of easy-to-find alternatives—and we knew technology could be the solution.
